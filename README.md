# Hide Job Postings

## What is it?

A Firefox browser extension to hide jobs in the LinkedIn job search results from certain companies.
Created mainly for the case where companies post the exact same job for every major city in Canada, so when you're searching for remote jobs in all of Canada you have to scroll past the same posting like 20 times. Or maybe you just don't want to see jobs from certain companies.

In theory instead of using an extension you can try to exclude the company from the search results by doing "NOT (company name)", but I had mixed results with that and it sometimes hid other companies as well.

Currently the extension uses Manifest V2.

## How to use

### Adding a company to the list

Two ways to add a company to the list of companies you want to hide jobs from:

1. Enter the name of the company in the input field in the popup, and click the "+" button to add it to the list.
2. On the search results page, right click the job post and select "Hide jobs from this company" from the context menu.

### Show/hide posts

Beside each company name in the list of hidden companies there are two buttons. The first button allows you to toggle between showing or hiding the posts from a company. Click it to change between show/hide.

### Remove company from the list

Click the delete button (trash can icon) beside the company name to remove it from the list. This will also show any hidden posts from that company.

Or if you want to remove all entries from the list, click the "Clear all" button.

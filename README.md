# Hide Job Postings

## What is it?

A Firefox browser extension to hide jobs in the LinkedIn job search results from certain companies.
Created mainly for the case where companies post the exact same job for every major city in Canada, so when you're searching for remote jobs in all of Canada you have to scroll past the same posting like 20 times.
In theory instead of using an extension you can try to exclude the company from the search results by doing "NOT (company name)", but I had mixed results with that and it sometimes hid other companies as well.

## How to use

To do. Add detailed instructions/screenshots.

## Work in progress:

- error handling (make sure error clears if you try to enter invalid name and then do a valid one, hide popup content if not on correct page)
- make it prettier (refactoring)
- :bug: On initial load of extension, hiding via context menu before ever opening popup means the values are not saved to storage
